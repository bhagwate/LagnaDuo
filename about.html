<p>This website is owned and managed by Partho Banerjee, that’s me. I’m very happy that you are here.</p>

<p>I have been a full time IT and software professional for 14 years and have done Master's in Computer Applications. I am certified corporate IT trainer by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, India and IBM. I have worked with leading IT companies in banking and financial services domain at global cities including London, Singapore, Mumbai, Copenhagen, Hong Kong  etc.</p>

<p><b>My journey in Vedic astrology, numerology and spiritual science began</b> in the year 1999 and I started horoscope analysis in 2001. All through that decade, I was pursuing my full time job in the IT and astrology in parallel.</p>

<p>"Scientific Astro Solution” might sound like just another name to some, but it reflects truly unique benefits this site offers to it’s visitors.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;"><b>I am among very few astrologers who would talk about patterns and events in the past of one's life before giving predictions.</b></span> Future predictions can be verified ONLY in future but past patterns in life can be instantly agreed upon. This helps in better understanding and builds the trust between astrologer and the questioner.</p>

<p>My vision is to deliver a message : you create own destiny by virtue of karma; karma is your free will. Destiny is nothing but the outcome of karma, in a time bound fashion - something that vedic astrologers study under dasha system, transits and numerous other tools.</p>

<p>In my eventful journey of more than a decade and half as practicing astrologer, I have done consultations for people from different walks of life across various cultures and countries (thanks to the internet).</p>

</span></ul>

<p>During true vedic times, astrologers did free consultation and the state (the ruler, the kings/queens) took care of their expenses like housing, food and all other requirements.</p>
<p>In modern times, the astrologers charge money because the state does not follow the old vedic tradition. I see nothing wrong with that, so long as astrologers genuinely help people. Unfortunately, as we have bad intentioned people in every domain of public life, astrologers aren't out of it.</p>

<p>This website is embodiment of what makes a person truly unique and lovable. It’s about inducing a sense of fulfillment and harmony within oneself and with the world around.</p>
